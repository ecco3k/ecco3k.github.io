        ("<strong>MOSHERS");
        ("<br/><p><strong>MOSHERS is a collection of NFTs born from my love for hardcore music and the hardcore scene, as a way to keep engaged whilst in lockdown. 
        Inspired by DIY hardcore ethics, I will be drawing, coding this website, and creating the smart contract for this project myself with the help of
        my friends. DEMO 2021 will be limited to 1000 and free to mint on the Ethereum blockchain soon... In the meantime follow the project on instagram @moshers.io and twitter @moshersnft.
        See you in the pit!!</strong></p>");
